My personal smal system info CLI app written in C

How to get an ASCII image into the compiled binary file:
1. Convert the picture with "jp2a" to ASCII
2. You can use my small helper tool "ascii2c" to convert ASCII to a .c file
3. Include your .c file in your main program
4. Use "printf(ansi_pic);" in your code to display the colored image in the terminal

Have fun !
